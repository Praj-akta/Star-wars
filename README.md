# Star-wars
A Star Wars application using React JS and GraphQL. I have fetched the information using the Star Wars API public graph (https://studio.apollographql.com/public/star-wars-swapi/variant/current/home). The website displays various types of films where you can sort by title, episode number and released date. You can also view single film details which will contain video, related articles, description, characters, species, vehicles, etc. information.  

The website is mobile-friendly and responsive so that you can easily watch the website on the go on your tablet, mobile phones or laptop.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can start by:

### `npm install` 
Which will install the neccessary node modules (packages, dependencies).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
